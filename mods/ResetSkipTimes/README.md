🗑️ Resets times which were achieved using skips not possible on the Steam version of the game. Specifically on the Xbox version of the game in The Third Temple there is a finish sitting out-of-bounds allowing the entire level to be skipped.

> A future version of this mod may save separate times for with and without skip so you can switch between them by installing or uninstalling this mod.

Important info:

- Best time in your save will get reset if it is under a threshold
- Need to trigger a save before it will be updated (eg. by beating the level)
- Level leaderboard best time is preserved
- Global leaderboard will only update if your total time including the non-skip time is lower than your global leaderboard time while this mod is active
- The NeonLite "Copy PB times" button will copy the non-skip times so that the they can be compared with Steam players
