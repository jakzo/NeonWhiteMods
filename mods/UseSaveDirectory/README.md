Saves ghost and game progress to the file system instead of to Xbox servers.

Important things to note:

- Your save folder location and structure should be the same as the Steam game (`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\Little Flag Software, LLC\Neon White\<xbox_user_id>`)
  - There is an option to configure the location of the save directory
- If the save directory for your user (the folder with the long number name) does not exist, your user's Xbox save will be copied to the folder when the game starts up
  - There is an option to disable this
- While the mod is active your Xbox will not be altered
  - Uninstalling the mod will let you use your Xbox save again
